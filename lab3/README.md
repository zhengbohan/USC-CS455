1.1)

purchase = .75 + 1.5 
purchase = 2.25
payment = 2.50
change = payment - purchase
change = 2.5 - 2.25
change = .25

1.2)
This error is because "change" is represented as a double (a fraction) and the computer has no exact representation for this particular value as a double.  

2.1) This time the change outputted was 0.65 exactly, which is the correct answer.

3.1) From the ex3 directory
``` 
cp ex2/CashReg*.java .
```

4.1) The "Change total" entries to do not match the expected output because only a 0 change object is being returned.

The "Total" entries also do not match the expected total purchase amount because giveChange() does not reset the total purchase amount.
